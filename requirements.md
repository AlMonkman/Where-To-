# Requirements

## Vision

Have you ever wanted to go on vacation, but had no idea *where to* go? We have the solution for you! Take our brief questionnaire and *Where To?* will give you the perfect destination for your next vacation.

## Scope

- IN

  - The webpage will recommend destinations to the user based on their input.

  - The webpage will store the users previous recommendations to local storage for the user to refer back to.

- OUT

  - The webpage will **never** charge the user.

### Minimum Viable Product

Our MVP is for the webpage to recommend at least one destination to the user.

### Stretch Goals

Return a top three destination list to the user based on their input.

## Functional Requirements

1. A user can take the questionnaire as many times as they want.

2. A user can check their previous results.

### Data Flow

The first clicks the "Get Started" button that takes them to questionnaire. The user then answers a few yes/no questions and then they are able to view their results.
